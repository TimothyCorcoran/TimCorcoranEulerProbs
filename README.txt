Hello there.  I'm just intending to use this service to store and show my solutions for the logical problems posted on ProjectEuler.net.  Through this, I'm teaching myself algorithms used to solve difficult programming problems, as well as Python.

Also, this is my first GitHub repository.  Doesn't show much yet but I'm working on a few projects I'm not ready to share yet.
